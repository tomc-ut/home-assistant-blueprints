# Scheduled Outlet Blueprint for Home Assistant

This Home Assistant automation blueprint turns a power outlet **on and off on a configurable schedule**, with:

- Two separate time sets
- Custom **on/off times**
- Configurable **date ranges**
- Specific **days of the week**
- Recovery behavior after **Home Assistant restarts**

The outlet **defaults to ON**, and is only powered OFF during matching time/date windows.
